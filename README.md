# ini-parser
A small ini parser for my personal use.
written in c99.

originally written for a game project that I never finished, something about licensing...
I had test cases in the game project but didn't migrate them here for some reason,
and thinking back I think most where of the assume success verity.


the code is a bit sticky in my opinion, and a few things should change...
